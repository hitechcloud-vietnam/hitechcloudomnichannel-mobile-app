 * Cold-start deep link to a conversation or contact (`<brand-scheme>://conversations/:id` or
 * `.../contacts/:id`, e.g. from a push notification once delivery lands) arrives before the auth
 * bootstrap gate resolves. `(app)/_layout.tsx` redirects an unauthenticated visitor to sign-in,
 * which drops the original target — expo-router has no built-in "return to this deep link after
 * auth" mechanism. This module stashes the resolved route path in memory at launch (read once,
 * before any redirect can fire) so sign-in can navigate there instead of the default `/` after a
 * successful login.
 *
 * In-memory only (not persisted): a cold-start deep link is only meaningful for THIS launch: if
 * the process is killed before sign-in completes, the notification (once real push delivery
 * exists) would redeliver or the user re-opens the link.

 * for a push-notification deep link, e.g. `<brand-scheme>://conversations/12345`) and one that
